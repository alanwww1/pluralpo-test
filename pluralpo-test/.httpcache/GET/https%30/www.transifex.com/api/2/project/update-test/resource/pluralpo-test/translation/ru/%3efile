msgid ""
"PM3.HD (Project Mayhem III High Definition) was based on the design of the "
"old default skin Project Mayhem III by Chokemaniac.[CR][CR]This skin was "
"created as XBMC moved off the xbox platform onto PC's.   People were wanting"
" to use XBMC on High Definition TV in 720p and 1080p and it came to my "
"attention that the old default Project Mayhem III skin looked great on the "
"low resolution xbox but looked very blocky when scaled up to Hi definition."
"    So PM3.HD was created to fill the gap for High definition users with our"
" first official \"stable\" release of XBMC for Linux, OSX and Windows."
